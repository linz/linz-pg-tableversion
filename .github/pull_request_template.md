<!-- Release checklist. Uncomment this section if relevant.
## Checklist

- [ ] Update local tags using `git fetch --tags`.
- [ ] Check `git tag` for the latest released version.
- [ ] Depending on whether this is a major (X+1.0.0), minor (X.Y+1.0), or patch (X.Y.Z+1) release:
   - If this is a major or minor release, create a `release-X.Y` branch.
   - If this is a patch release, check out the existing `release-X.Y` branch.
- [ ] Add a change log entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.
- [ ] Look for anywhere there is a list of version numbers, such as the `Makefile`, test files, or others. In all those places, add your new version.
- [ ] Finish any other changes on this branch, such as merging in origin/master.
- [ ] Push the branch.
- [ ] Create a pull request for the branch.
- [ ] Wait for the pull request to build.
- [ ] Tag the final commit on the branch with `X.Y.Z`, for example, `1.10.2`.
- [ ] `git push origin TAG` with the tag created above.
- [ ] Wait for the package to appear in the [test repository](https://packagecloud.io/linz/test).
- [ ] Manually promote the package from the test repository to production.
- [ ] Wait for the pull request to build with the Debian packaging changelog commit and merge it.
- [ ] Bump the Makefile version to the next patch.
